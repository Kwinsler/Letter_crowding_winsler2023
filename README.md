# Code for "Fundamental changes in the spatial properties of visual perception after a lifetime of reading crowded letters"

###### Will add full citation here

This repository contains the stimulus presentation code, modeling code, plotting code, and compiled data for study 1 and 2 of "Fundamental changes in the spatial properties of visual perception after a lifetime of reading crowded letters"

Cloning or downloading this repository should make it easy to see or use the task, as well as recreate the models and figures reported in the paper. 

Study 1 was preregistered [here](https://osf.io/3fpuw) and study 2 was preregistered [here](https://osf.io/fpwv3)

## Stimulus presentation 

(Python code)

These tasks were run using PsychoPy on a Linux operating system. They should run on any recent version of PsychoPy and operating system (perhaps a few minimal changes would be needed depending on the set-up).

If you wish to use the version of PsychoPy that these tasks were originally developed/tested in, it can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/2020.2.10)

## Analysis

(R code)

These data were analyzed in R (version 4+) using mixed models fit with lme4. A data file is included for each study. After downloading/cloning the repository, it should be straightforward to recreate the models and plots reported in the paper by just opening the code in R, installing any missing packages and changing the path for loading the data.
